This repo is entirely defunct. The project is now being continued at [the website](https://github.com/C-C-Coalback/Conquest-LCG-Site).
This repo will be left up just in case something really bad happens, but also because I like having it up. I will probably make it private once the
website is fully up, and just keep this as a backup.
